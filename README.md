# Hey there! ðŸ§‹

I'm Marg, a Computer Science student from the Philippines.

I'm interested in Cybersecurity and Data Science. I'm currently learning their technology stacks.

Aside from learning, I follow the developments of the other aspects of technology (as well as its memes) through social media, and play games such as Minecraft, Roblox, and Genshin Impact.
