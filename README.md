# Hey there! ðŸ§‹

I'm Marg, a Computer Science student from the Philippines.

I'm interested in Cybersecurity and Data Science. I'm currently learning the technology stack of them.

Aside from learning, I follow the developments of the other aspects of technology (as well as its memes) through social media. I like to play games such as Minecraft, Roblox, and Genshin Impact.
